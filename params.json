All API response information is \r\nnormalized from `snake_case` to `camelCase` for easier typing and recognition.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nwk.getStudyQueue().then(function(studyQueue) {\r\n  console.log(studyQueue.reviewsAvailableNextHour);\r\n  console.log(studyQueue.nextReviewDate);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the WkApi will take care of caching requests for 1 hour by default. \r\nIf you would like to change this caching time, you may use the `setExpiry(number)` method \r\nof the WkApi class. This number is in seconds.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nwk.setExpiry(120); // requests will be cached for 2 minutes\r\n```\r\n\r\nLastly, the WkApi will update the `userInformation` object with every request, as it is included \r\nfrom the server with every request. Requesting, for example, the Study Queue, and then the User \r\nInformation, will result in the User Information already being available for use.\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n\r\nComing soon.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
